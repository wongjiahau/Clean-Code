# Why write clean code?
*“Anyone can write a code that computer can understand.  
But only good programmer can write a code that human can understand.”*

Do you know who will be the victim of *dirty* code?   
### **YOU!**

Because you will be the one who read the code in the future.  
You will be cursing yourself like :

What does that mean?
Is this comment important?
